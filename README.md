# tic-tac-toe

step one: get some friends
step two: learn how to draw perpendicular lines
step three: play tic-tac-toe

there program done. you're welcome world.



But serisouly, I'm tasked with making a tic-tac-toe program that can be hosted on a webiite, played by two people, can deduce a winner, and doesn't look terrible(basically)

Here in this section I will  be describing my approach in tackling such a task. 


First, I will start with CSS to make a crude t-t-t board, I think I'll need the basic layout before I can write the corresponding code since placement and pattern are basically the entire win conditions. Again this is just a hunch as to where to start ... I'm probably just an a-hole.


Second, Javascript in order to try to get the program working first. The program will be written all at once and ill pray for the best. Kidding. I feel like getting the program to recognize a selection is a good place to start; however, recognizing the win conditions is probably the most important/ difficult. Ill approach the program starting with one button, see if i can apply that functionality to all buttons, then move on to the win conditions. 

Third, after the program works(hopefully) Ill return to the styling and layout of the page. One word: gunfights. also kidding (that's a theme here folks). I'll probably use bootstrap to construct a grid layout for game and the scoring. 

4th, I'm going to make the HTML last. why? Becaue I effing forgot, that's why! apparently: 
			var erich = function cant(chachbag) { 
				for(i; i <= gaClass.lenght; i++)
		}
